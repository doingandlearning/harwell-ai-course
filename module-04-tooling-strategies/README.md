# Module 4: Tooling Strategies (Mixed Environment)

## Learning objectives

- Apply the “sidecar” workflow: using a browser-based AI (e.g. MS Copilot) effectively alongside an IDE without native AI plugins (e.g. NetBeans/Universal).
- Describe the “integrated” workflow: in-IDE features (context awareness, diff views) for teams using JetBrains or VS Code.
- Compare chat interfaces vs. inline code completion: pros, cons, and when to use each.
- Choose a workflow that fits your team’s tools and constraints.

## Suggested talking points

- Sidecar workflow: copy/paste or “describe + paste back”; keeping context in the prompt (file names, stack, constraints).
- Integrated workflow: how IDE plugins use project context; diff views and apply/reject.
- Chat vs. inline: chat for exploration, design, and multi-file tasks; inline for localised edits and completions.
- Mixed environments: not everyone on the same IDE; how to make the best of browser-based AI.
- Security and policy: what can be pasted where; internal vs. public tools.

## Suggested demos

- **Sidecar:** Use browser Copilot (or similar) next to NetBeans/Universal: get a snippet from a prompt, paste, run; show how to include “I’m in Spring Boot 3, Java 17” in the prompt.
- **Integrated:** Short demo of JetBrains or VS Code AI (if available): inline completion, “explain this,” and applying a suggested change via diff.
- **Comparison:** Same small task (e.g. “add validation to this field”) via chat vs. inline; discuss trade-offs.

## Suggested exercises

- **Map your setup:** Write down your IDE + AI tool(s); label whether you’re sidecar or integrated; list one improvement you could make this week.
- **Prompt template:** Draft a 2–3 line “context header” you’ll paste into chat (stack, project type, constraints).
- **Pair:** With someone on a different setup, explain your workflow and get one tip from theirs.

## Suggested running time

45–60 minutes
