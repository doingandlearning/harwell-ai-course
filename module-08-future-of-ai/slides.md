## Bridge from Module 7

**What we learned last time:**

- <span class="fragment">**How** AI APIs work (stateful, non-deterministic, streaming, cost)</span>

**The context:**

- <span class="fragment">AI is moving fast</span>
- <span class="fragment">Let's understand what's changed recently</span>
- <span class="fragment">What's coming next</span>

**Today:** Recent developments, near-term trends, and concrete next steps.

## Recent developments: last 6 months

**Reasoning models:**

- <span class="fragment">Models that show step-by-step reasoning (e.g. o1-style)</span>
- <span class="fragment">✅ Better accuracy</span>
- <span class="fragment">✅ Can verify reasoning process</span>
- <span class="fragment">**Impact**: More reliable code generation, better explanations</span>

**Agentic workflows:**

- <span class="fragment">Models that plan → execute → reflect</span>
- <span class="fragment">✅ Can handle multi-step tasks autonomously</span>
- <span class="fragment">**Impact**: AI can plan refactoring, execute steps, verify results</span>

**What this means:**

- <span class="fragment">✅ More reliable AI assistance</span>
- <span class="fragment">✅ AI can handle complex, multi-step tasks</span>
- <span class="fragment">✅ Better explanations and reasoning</span>
- <span class="fragment">⚠️ Still need human oversight</span>
- <span class="fragment">⚠️ Still need to verify output</span>

## Near-term: what's coming next

**Trend 1: Better IDE integration**

- <span class="fragment">More AI features built into IDEs</span>
- <span class="fragment">Better context awareness</span>
- <span class="fragment">Smoother workflows</span>
- <span class="fragment">**Impact**: Less switching between tools</span>

**Trend 2: More enterprise controls**

- <span class="fragment">Better data privacy controls</span>
- <span class="fragment">More governance features</span>
- <span class="fragment">Compliance tools</span>
- <span class="fragment">**Impact**: Safer AI adoption in enterprises</span>

**Trend 3: RAG/MCP becoming mainstream**

- <span class="fragment">RAG-enhanced tools more common</span>
- <span class="fragment">MCP adoption growing</span>
- <span class="fragment">Better integration with knowledge bases</span>
- <span class="fragment">**Impact**: AI knows your context better</span>

**Trend 4: Impact on Java/Spring ecosystems**

- <span class="fragment">Better Spring Boot code generation</span>
- <span class="fragment">Improved understanding of Java patterns</span>
- <span class="fragment">Better refactoring assistance</span>
- <span class="fragment">**Impact**: More effective AI assistance for Java developers</span>

## What to try now vs. what to watch

**Try now** (practical focus):

- <span class="fragment">✅ **Prompt engineering**: Apply what you learned (3Cs, iterative refinement)</span>
- <span class="fragment">✅ **Code generation**: Use for boilerplate, entities, services</span>
- <span class="fragment">✅ **Code explanation**: Understand legacy code before changing</span>
- <span class="fragment">✅ **Safe refactoring**: With tests, review carefully</span>
- <span class="fragment">✅ **Tool optimization**: Sidecar or integrated workflows</span>

**Watch** (stay informed, don't chase):

- <span class="fragment">⚠️ **Reasoning models**: Watch adoption, try when stable</span>
- <span class="fragment">⚠️ **Agentic workflows**: Monitor, understand implications</span>
- <span class="fragment">⚠️ **New tools**: Evaluate, don't adopt immediately</span>
- <span class="fragment">⚠️ **Latest models**: Stay informed, but don't chase every release</span>

**Avoid:**

- <span class="fragment">❌ Chasing every new release</span>
- <span class="fragment">❌ Adopting bleeding-edge without evaluation</span>
- <span class="fragment">❌ Ignoring fundamentals (prompting, review, testing)</span>
- <span class="fragment">❌ Over-relying on AI without understanding</span>

## Next steps: what must feel different on Monday

**The challenge:**

- <span class="fragment">"You've learned a lot. What will you actually do differently?"</span>
- <span class="fragment">❌ Easy to forget without a plan</span>

**One habit to adopt:**

- <span class="fragment">Example: "Use few-shot prompting for all code generation"</span>
- <span class="fragment">Example: "Always include context header in prompts"</span>
- <span class="fragment">Example: "Review AI output with evaluation checklist"</span>

**One tool to try:**

- <span class="fragment">Example: "Optimize sidecar workflow with context headers"</span>
- <span class="fragment">Example: "Try integrated IDE features"</span>

**One prompt template:**

- <span class="fragment">Example: Context header template</span>
- <span class="fragment">Example: Code generation prompt template</span>

**Commitment:**

- <span class="fragment">Write it down</span>
- <span class="fragment">Share with partner or team</span>
- <span class="fragment">Set a reminder to review in one week</span>
