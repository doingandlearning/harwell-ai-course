# The Future of AI & Development

**Module 8 — Harwell Prompt Engineering**

---

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module you will be able to:

- Summarise recent developments (e.g. last ~6 months): reasoning models, agentic workflows
- Anticipate what's coming next for Java developers: tooling, practices, and architectural patterns
- Place the course in context: what to try now vs. what to watch
- Leave with a simple "next steps" plan (e.g. one habit or tool to adopt)

---

## Bridge from Module 7

**What we learned yesterday:**

- **How** AI APIs work (stateful, non-deterministic, streaming, cost)

**The context:**

- AI is moving fast
- Let's understand what's changed recently
- What's coming next

**Today:** Recent developments, near-term trends, and concrete next steps.

## Recent developments: last 6 months

**Reasoning models:**

- Models that show step-by-step reasoning (e.g. o1-style)
- ✅ Better accuracy
- ✅ Can verify reasoning process
- **Impact**: More reliable code generation, better explanations

**Agentic workflows:**

- Models that plan → execute → reflect
- ✅ Can handle multi-step tasks autonomously
- **Impact**: AI can plan refactoring, execute steps, verify results

**What this means:**

- ✅ More reliable AI assistance
- ✅ AI can handle complex, multi-step tasks
- ✅ Better explanations and reasoning
- ⚠️ Still need human oversight
- ⚠️ Still need to verify output

## Near-term: what's coming next

**Trend 1: Better IDE integration**

- More AI features built into IDEs
- Better context awareness
- Smoother workflows
- **Impact**: Less switching between tools

**Trend 2: More enterprise controls**

- Better data privacy controls
- More governance features
- Compliance tools
- **Impact**: Safer AI adoption in enterprises

**Trend 3: RAG/MCP becoming mainstream**

- RAG-enhanced tools more common
- MCP adoption growing
- Better integration with knowledge bases
- **Impact**: AI knows your context better

**Trend 4: Impact on Java/Spring ecosystems**

- Better Spring Boot code generation
- Improved understanding of Java patterns
- Better refactoring assistance
- **Impact**: More effective AI assistance for Java developers

## What to try now vs. what to watch

**Try now** (practical focus):

- ✅ **Prompt engineering**: Apply what you learned (3Cs, iterative refinement)
- ✅ **Code generation**: Use for boilerplate, entities, services
- ✅ **Code explanation**: Understand legacy code before changing
- ✅ **Safe refactoring**: With tests, review carefully
- ✅ **Tool optimization**: Sidecar or integrated workflows

**Watch** (stay informed, don't chase):

- ⚠️ **Reasoning models**: Watch adoption, try when stable
- ⚠️ **Agentic workflows**: Monitor, understand implications
- ⚠️ **New tools**: Evaluate, don't adopt immediately
- ⚠️ **Latest models**: Stay informed, but don't chase every release

**Avoid:**

- ❌ Chasing every new release
- ❌ Adopting bleeding-edge without evaluation
- ❌ Ignoring fundamentals (prompting, review, testing)
- ❌ Over-relying on AI without understanding

## Next steps: what must feel different on Monday

**The challenge:**

- "You've learned a lot. What will you actually do differently?"
- ❌ Easy to forget without a plan
- ❌ Hard to change habits

**The solution:**

**One habit to adopt:**

- Example: "Use few-shot prompting for all code generation"
- Example: "Always include context header in prompts"
- Example: "Review AI output with evaluation checklist"

**One tool to try:**

- Example: "Optimize sidecar workflow with context headers"
- Example: "Try integrated IDE features"

**One prompt template:**

- Example: Context header template
- Example: Code generation prompt template

**Commitment:**

- Write it down
- Share with partner or team
- Set a reminder to review in one week

---

## Closing: key takeaways

**Fundamentals matter:**

- Prompting principles don't change
- Review practices remain important
- Testing is still essential

**Stay informed, don't chase:**

- Understand trends
- Adopt when ready
- Focus on practical skills

**Practical focus:**

- What to try now: Prompt engineering, code generation, safe refactoring
- What to watch: Reasoning models, agentic workflows, new tools

**Next steps:**

- One habit
- One tool
- One template

---

## Final message

**AI is a tool. You're the developer. Use it wisely.**

- Focus on fundamentals: prompting, review, testing
- Stay informed, but don't chase every release
- What must feel different on Monday? You have a plan.
