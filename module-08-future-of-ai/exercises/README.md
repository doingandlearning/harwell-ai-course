# Module 8 — Exercises

**For delegates.** Complete these during or after the Module 8 session. You can do them on your own or in pairs.

---

## Objective

By completing these exercises, you will:

- Create a concrete "next steps" plan with one habit, one tool, and one template
- Share your key takeaway and open questions with others
- Identify which modules you want to explore deeper
- Leave with actionable commitments for Monday

---

## Scenario

You've completed the course. Now it's time to turn learning into action. These exercises will help you create a concrete plan for what you'll do differently.

---

## Exercise 1: Commitment — your next steps plan

**Your task:**

Create your **"next steps" plan** with three specific commitments:

1. **One habit to adopt** (from the course)
   - Example: "Use few-shot prompting for all code generation prompts"
   - Example: "Always include context header in chat prompts"
   - Example: "Review AI output using the evaluation checklist before applying"

2. **One tool to try** (workflow optimization)
   - Example: "Optimize my sidecar workflow by creating a reusable context header template"
   - Example: "Try integrated IDE features in IntelliJ"
   - Example: "Set up prompt templates for my 3 most common tasks"

3. **One prompt template to create** (reusable)
   - Example: Context header template for my stack
   - Example: Code generation prompt template
   - Example: Refactoring prompt template

**Requirements:**

- Be **specific** and **actionable**
- Write it down (don't just think about it)
- Make it something you can start Monday

**Format:** Short list or table.

**Then:** Share with a partner. Discuss: How will you remember to do this? What support do you need?

**Time:** About 10 minutes.

**Example next steps plan:**

**One habit to adopt:**
- "Always include my context header template in every chat prompt. I'll keep it in a notes file and copy-paste it."

**One tool to try:**
- "Create prompt templates for my 3 most common tasks: (1) generate entity, (2) explain code, (3) refactor method. I'll save them in my team wiki."

**One prompt template to create:**
- "Context header: 'Spring Boot 3, Java 17, JPA. Use constructor injection, not @Autowired. Follow Spring Boot best practices.'"

**Action plan:**
- Monday: Create context header template, save in notes
- This week: Create 3 prompt templates, test them
- Next week: Review what's working, refine templates

**Key insight:** Make it specific, actionable, and easy to start. Small steps lead to big changes.

## Exercise 2: Share — key takeaway and open question

**Your task:**

- Write down **one key takeaway** from the course
- Write down **one open question** you still have

**Format:** Two sentences.

**Then:** Share in pairs or table groups. Discuss takeaways and help answer questions.

**Time:** About 10 minutes.

<details>
<summary>Example Solution for Exercise 2</summary>

**Example answers:**

**Key takeaway:**
- "Prompting is a skill I can improve. The 3Cs (clarity, context, constraints) and iterative refinement make a huge difference in output quality."

**Open question:**
- "How do I know when to use RAG vs. just including context in my prompt? When is RAG worth the setup complexity?"

**Discussion:**
- Share takeaways — learn from others' insights
- Answer questions — help each other understand
- Note questions for follow-up if needed

**Key insight:** Sharing helps reinforce learning and fills knowledge gaps.

## Exercise 3: Optional — module deep dive vote

**Your task:**

If time allows, do a quick **dot-vote** or **sticky-note** exercise:

**Question:** "Which module do you want to go deeper on later?"

**Options:**
- Module 2: Core Prompt Engineering
- Module 3: AI-Assisted Java Development
- Module 4: Tooling Strategies
- Module 5: RAG
- Module 6: MCP
- Module 7: AI APIs

**Format:** Write module number/name on sticky note, place on board or share in chat.

**Then:** Facilitator can note popular choices for follow-up materials or advanced sessions.

**Time:** About 5 minutes (optional).

## Final Deliverables

Before leaving, ensure you have:

- [ ] Created your next steps plan (Exercise 1) — one habit, one tool, one template
- [ ] Shared your key takeaway and open question (Exercise 2)
- [ ] Written down your commitments (don't just think about them)
- [ ] Set a reminder to review your plan in one week

---

## Extensions (Optional)

If you finish early or want to go deeper:

1. **Create your prompt library:** Document your best prompts for common tasks. Share with your team.

2. **Set up your workflow:** Actually create your context header template and prompt templates. Test them this week.

3. **Plan your learning:** Identify 2-3 resources to follow for staying informed about AI trends (without getting overwhelmed).

4. **Team sharing:** Plan how you'll share what you learned with your team. Create a short summary or presentation.

---

## Key Learning Points

- **Turn learning into action**: Create specific, actionable next steps
- **Start small**: One habit, one tool, one template
- **Share and learn**: Discuss takeaways and questions with others
- **Review and refine**: Set reminder to review your plan in one week
- **Focus on fundamentals**: Prompting, review, testing don't change

---

## After the exercises

- **Keep your next steps plan** — refer to it Monday morning
- **Share with your team** — help others learn from the course
- **Review in one week** — what's working? What needs adjustment?
- **Stay informed** — follow trends, but don't chase every release
- **Remember**: AI is a tool. You're the developer. Use it wisely.

**Thank you for participating in the course!**
