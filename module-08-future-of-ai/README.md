# Module 8: The Future of AI & Development

## Learning objectives

- Summarise recent developments (e.g. last ~6 months): reasoning models, agentic workflows.
- Anticipate what’s coming next for Java developers: tooling, practices, and architectural patterns.
- Place the course in context: what to try now vs. what to watch.
- Leave with a simple “next steps” plan (e.g. one habit or tool to adopt).

## Suggested talking points

- Recent developments: reasoning models (e.g. o1-style), agentic workflows (plan → execute → reflect), and what that means for coding assistance.
- Near-term: better IDE integration, more enterprise controls, RAG/MCP becoming mainstream; impact on Java and Spring ecosystems.
- What to do now: adopt one workflow from the course; revisit prompt discipline; stay informed without chasing every release.
- What to watch: multi-step agents, codebase-wide reasoning, and governance (security, licensing, compliance).
- Closing: tie back to “what must feel different on Monday”—one concrete takeaway per person if possible.

## Suggested demos

- **Optional:** Short clip or slide of a “reasoning” or “agentic” demo (e.g. model that plans steps then executes) to make the future tangible.
- **Recap:** One slide with “Course in one picture”: modules 1–8 as a journey from foundations → Java → architecture → future.
- **Next steps:** Show a simple checklist or template (e.g. “This week: try one refactor with AI; review output before applying”).

## Suggested exercises

- **Commitment:** Write down one thing you’ll do differently in the next week (e.g. “Use few-shot for all code-gen prompts” or “Try the sidecar workflow with our wiki”).
- **Share:** In pairs or table groups, share your one takeaway and one open question.
- **Optional:** Quick dot-vote or sticky-note on “Which module do you want to go deeper on later?” for follow-up or materials.

## Suggested running time

30–45 minutes
