# Module 1 — Demos

This folder contains facilitator notes and materials for the Module 1 demos.

## Demo 1: Public vs. enterprise (context/behaviour)

**Purpose:** Show how the same prompt can be treated differently (or should be used differently) in public vs. enterprise environments.

**Materials:** `01-public-vs-enterprise.md` + `prompts/same-prompt.txt`

**Setup:** Access to both a public chat (e.g. ChatGPT) and an enterprise instance (e.g. MS Copilot with org tenant) — or use screenshots/slides if only one is available.

---

## Demo 2: Hallucination check

**Purpose:** Show that models can give plausible but wrong answers, and how to spot and correct.

**Materials:** `02-hallucination-check.md` + `prompts/hallucination-prompts.txt`

**Setup:** Any chat interface (public or enterprise). Use synthetic examples only.

---

## Demo 3 (optional): Model comparison

**Purpose:** Illustrate “right tool for the job” with one coding question in two models.

**Materials:** `03-model-comparison.md` + `prompts/model-comparison-prompt.txt`

**Setup:** Two different models (e.g. GPT-4 and Claude, or Copilot vs. ChatGPT). Same prompt, compare tone and accuracy.

## Presenter notes

- Do **not** paste real proprietary code or internal APIs in public tools during the session.
- Use the sample prompts as-is or adapt to your audience (e.g. swap “Spring Boot” for their stack).
- If you cannot run live (e.g. no internet or policy), use pre-recorded screenshots or slide versions of the same prompts and outputs.
