# Using this folder as your GitHub repo

This **for_repo** folder is intended to be the contents of your **GitHub repository** for the course.

1. **Create a new repo** on GitHub (e.g. `harwell-prompt-engineering`).
2. **Copy or move** everything inside `for_repo/` (not the folder itself) into your repo root — or clone the repo and copy these files into it.
3. **Commit and push** (README.md, COURSE_OUTLINE.md, modules, POCs, etc.).
4. **Update your website** — In `for_website/index.html`, replace `REPO_LINK_PLACEHOLDER` with your repo URL (e.g. `https://github.com/yourname/harwell-prompt-engineering`).

Do **not** push facilitator-only materials (e.g. TEACHING_NOTES, BEFORE_DELIVERY) if you keep them elsewhere; they are not included in for_repo.
