# Module 2 — Demos

This folder contains facilitator notes and materials for the Module 2 demos.

## Demo 1: Three prompts — vague → clear → constrained

**Purpose:** Show how adding clarity, context, and constraints improves output quality.

**Materials:** `01-three-prompts.md` + `prompts/vague-clear-constrained.txt`

**Setup:** Any chat interface (public or enterprise). Use synthetic Spring Boot examples only.

---

## Demo 2: Few-shot — without vs. with examples

**Purpose:** Demonstrate how adding 1–2 examples changes output style dramatically.

**Materials:** `02-few-shot.md` + `prompts/few-shot-examples.txt`

**Setup:** Any chat interface. Show same task with and without examples.

---

## Demo 3: Debug a prompt — iterative refinement

**Purpose:** Show the iterative process of refining a prompt when output is poor.

**Materials:** `03-debug-prompt.md` + `prompts/refinement-examples.txt`

**Setup:** Any chat interface. Start with poor output, refine, re-run, compare.

---

## Presenter notes

- Use **synthetic examples** only (no real internal code or APIs).
- Show the **problem** first (bad output), then the **solution** (refined prompt).
- Emphasize that **iterative refinement is normal** — don't expect perfect output first time.
- Keep demos focused on the technique, not on perfect code output.
