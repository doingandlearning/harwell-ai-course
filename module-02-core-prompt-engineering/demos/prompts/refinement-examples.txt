# Refinement examples

## Initial prompt (produces poor output)
Generate a Spring Boot controller for User

## Refined prompt (after seeing poor output)
Generate a Spring Boot 3 REST controller using Java 17. Use constructor injection (not @Autowired), return ResponseEntity<List<User>>, and include proper error handling. Don't use Optional for return types.

- Added constraint: Constructor injection (not @Autowired)
- Added constraint: Include error handling
- Added constraint: Don't use Optional for return types
