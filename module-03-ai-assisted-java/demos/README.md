# Module 3 — Demos

This folder contains facilitator notes and materials for the Module 3 demos.

## Demo 1: Spring Boot generation

**Purpose:** Show how to generate a complete Spring Boot entity, repository, and service from a simple spec, then refine iteratively.

**Materials:** `01-spring-boot-generation.md`

**Setup:** Access to AI chat tool (MS Copilot or approved tool). Use synthetic examples only.

---

## Demo 2: Legacy code explanation

**Purpose:** Show how AI can explain legacy code (JSF/GWT-style) and suggest modern equivalents.

**Materials:** `02-legacy-explanation.md` + sample legacy code snippet

**Setup:** Access to AI chat tool. Use synthetic legacy examples only (not real internal code).

---

## Demo 3: Refactoring with AI

**Purpose:** Show how to refactor verbose, procedural code to modern Java 17 style using Streams, with safety checks.

**Materials:** `03-refactoring.md` + sample code to refactor

**Setup:** Access to AI chat tool. IDE for running tests before/after refactoring.

---

## Demo 4: Unit test generation

**Purpose:** Show how to generate JUnit 5/Mockito tests, run them, and refine when tests fail.

**Materials:** `04-unit-testing.md` + sample service method to test

**Setup:** Access to AI chat tool. IDE with JUnit 5 and Mockito. Sample Spring Boot service method.

## Presenter notes

- Do **not** paste real proprietary code or internal APIs in public tools during the session.
- Use the sample code provided in each demo file (synthetic examples).
- If you cannot run live (e.g. no internet or policy), use pre-recorded screenshots or slide versions.
- Emphasize **review before paste** — always evaluate AI output.
- Show **iterative refinement** — first output may not be perfect.
